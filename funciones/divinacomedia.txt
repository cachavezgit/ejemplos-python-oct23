Canto I - The Inferno (Hell)

In the middle of the journey of our life,
I found myself in a dark wood,
For the straight path had been lost.

Ah, how hard it is to tell
What that wood was, wild, rough, and harsh,
The thought of it renews my fear!

It is so bitter that death is hardly more so.
But to treat of the good that I found there,
I will tell of the other things I saw there.

I cannot rightly say how I entered it,
So full of sleep was I at that point
When I abandoned the true way.

But when I reached the foot of a hill,
There where the valley, that had pierced my heart
With fear, came to an end,

I looked up and saw its shoulders
Arrayed in the rays of that planet
Which leads men straight on every road.

Then the fear, which had settled in the lake of my heart,
Through the night that I had spent so pitifully,
Was calmed a little.

And as he, who, with panting breath,
Has escaped from the sea to the shore,
Turns to the perilous waters and gazes,

So my soul, which still was fleeing,
Turned to look back at the pass
Which never left anyone alive.

After I had rested my weary body,
I made my way again along that lonely slope
Upward through the hidden path,

So that the firm foot always was the lower.
And, behold, almost at the beginning of the steep,
A leopard, light and very swift,

That was covered with a spotted pelt,
And did not move from before my face,
And only hindered my advance!
